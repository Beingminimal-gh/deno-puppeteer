    To ensure that all generated code strictly adheres to pure functional
    programming principles, follow these comprehensive guidelines. These
    instructions cover all 50 key concepts and best practices necessary for pure
    functional programming.
    1. Purity

       - Definition: All functions must be pure, meaning they always produce the
         same output for the same input and have no side effects.

         create new data structures with the desired modifications.
    3. First-Class Functions

       - Definition: Functions are treated as values and can be assigned to
         variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.

         promote abstraction and code reuse.

    4. Higher-Order Functions

       - Definition: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return
         them as results.
